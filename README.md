## Introduction

We recently created a new company in the GAMING industry. The company will have the following scheme:

20 Designers , 5 UI/UX Engineers ,10 Frontend Developers , 15 Data Engineers , 5 Backend Developers, 20 Account Managers, 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball, 10 Executives, 1 CEO/President

We need to choose 3 locations in the world and decide which one is the best one to locate our new company.

## Goal 

My goal  in this project has been, in addition to complying with the specifications, to try to create a clean and modular code, in such a way that instead of having to take fixed values of cities, to be able to do it dynamically and through the user interface.

# Considerations

The parameters below has been the ones that we have selected as importants for our company workers:
  ["vegan", "Startup", "nursery school", "school", "pubs", "starbucks", "train", "dog grummer"]
We didn't use the basketball as a search parameter as we don't consider that is importat for our company.

Because we are not a selfish company we don't want to choose what is the most importat parameter, so what we have decided is to create a poll (not necessarily on friday, this time) where every worker in the company will be able to give the weight/mark to every parameter. 
We don't have time for that so we have create a function we will give us that info for every worker (using the dirichlet distribution)


## Conclusions
